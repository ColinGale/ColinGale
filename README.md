## 🔥 What I'm Working On  

### 🏀 NCAA Basketball Predictor  
A **Random Forest Classifier** model that uses **advanced team metrics** to predict NCAA basketball game outcomes. This project applies **data science and machine learning** to analyze past performance and generate predictions.  

📌 [View the College Basketball Predictor README](https://github.com/ColinGale/College-Basketball-Predictor/blob/master/README.md)

### ♟️ GamBit Chess Engine  
A custom-built Java chess engine featuring **bitboard-based move generation**, **negamax with alpha-beta pruning**, and **quiescence search**.  
- Uses **MVV_LVA move ordering** and **bitwise optimization** for efficient evaluation  
- Benchmarked at ~**1.1 million nodes/sec**, evaluated around **2000–2250 ELO**  
- Future updates planned: **Zobrist hashing**, **advanced evaluation heuristics**, and **multithreaded root search**  
- GUI included — built with Java Swing
